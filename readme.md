This project is about to Predict premier league football match prediction. We applied feature engineering technique to create features that have impact on football match. We also used PCA(principle component analysis) on those features to reduce dimension of our data. This data is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/zaeemnalla/premier-league . This project is created by Md Nasar Uddin and Muntaqim Ahmed.
